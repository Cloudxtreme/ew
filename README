Briefly, this is an egrep wrapper.  It's everything I want from the program
called "ack", without all the other stuff that I don't want.

Before grep acquired '-I' (ignore binary files) and perhaps '--exclude-dir',
this would have much harder, but by now even the most "sta(b)le" distros
should have the requisite grep version.

Documentation is in the code.  And there's not really much to speak of...

TODO:

  - set GREP_OPTIONS explicitly if it is not already set (right now it expects
    you to set it yourself, to something like

        GREP_OPTIONS='--exclude-dir=.git'
